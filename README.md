# Online Retail Database System

## Overview

This project entails the design and development of a comprehensive database system for an online retail business. The system includes a robust back-end for user authentication, querying, and data insertion into a SQL database, along with a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) to facilitate interaction with the system.

## Features

### Back-End System Implementation
- **User Authentication:** Secure login mechanisms utilizing hashed password storage.
- **Product Management:** Efficient querying and display of products, allowing users to browse and search the catalog.
- **Order Processing:** Facilitates order placement, updates inventory levels, and generates order confirmations.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures consistency and integrity of database operations with transaction management for concurrent accesses.

### Command Line Interface (CLI) Development
- **User Login:** Secure user authentication via the CLI.
- **Product Search:** Allows users to search for products based on various criteria.
- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders and view order history.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in mechanisms to guide users and prevent invalid operations.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Users:** Stores user information and hashed passwords.
- **Products:** Contains product details, including inventory levels.
- **Orders:** Records order information and associated user details.

### SQL Implementation
- **Complex Queries:** Efficient data manipulation for user login, product search, order placement, and inventory management.
- **Normalization:** Ensures data integrity and eliminates redundancy.

### CLI
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear instructions and feedback for user actions.
- **Comprehensive Features:** Login, search, order placement, and error handling.

## Optimization and Scalability
- **Query Performance:** Optimized indexes for quick data retrieval.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle increasing numbers of users and expanding product listings.

## Documentation and Testing
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the database schema, system architecture, and CLI usage instructions.
- **Testing:** Extensive testing for functionality, reliability, and security.
